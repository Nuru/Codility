# Codility Rubidium 2018 challenge https://app.codility.com/programmers/challenges/rubidium2018/
#
# Correct and categorized as O(n*log(n))
#
# We sort the sheep according to their distance from the origin.
#
# As we go along, we keep track of the max shade size allowed by the sheep we have looked at.
#
# For each sheep, we consider the sheep fuather from the origin until we get to a sheep
# that is so far from the origin that no matter what its x and y coordinates are, it is too far
# for its shade to overlap the current sheep's at the current maximum size.
# (There is a little geometry involved, but pretty much only the Pythagorean theorem is needed to
# demonstrate that the formula used is correct.)
# I guess you could fix this by making a second pass through the list. The first pass (what is currently implemented)
# sets an upper bound on the distance between the closest sheep. Call that dq. The second pass goes through the
# list again, but checks each sheep against sheep after the adjacent sheep until it has gets to a sheep that is
# at least 2*(dq**2) away from it. But that seems overly complicated and technically Î©(n**2). Still, it might be
# the best set of trade-offs if this were a real-world problem seeking real-world efficiency.
